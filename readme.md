LamboAuth is a script that checks whether you're the owner of an EtherLambo or not. Here's how it works:

- First you're asked to sign a message with your current MetaMask address to prove you're the owner of that address.
- Next all of the EtherLambos are fetched from the contract.
- And finally your current MetaMask address is compared to all of the EtherLambos.
